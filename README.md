# Nusha Language Interpreter

## Overview

This project implements the core components of a simple programming language called **Nusha**.
It was developed as part of the **Principles of Programming Languages (ICSI 311)** course.

The goal of the assignment was to complete a provided skeleton project by implementing the **lexer, parser, and interpreter** so that all instructor-provided tests pass.

## What the Project Does

* Reads a program written in the Nusha language
* Breaks it into tokens (lexing)
* Converts tokens into a structured syntax tree (parsing)
* Executes the program using an interpreter

## Main Components

* **Lexer** – Converts raw text into tokens
* **Parser** – Builds the abstract syntax tree (AST)
* **Interpreter** – Executes the program
* **TokenManager** – Manages token flow
* **TextManager** – Handles input text processing
* **SyntaxErrorException** – Reports syntax errors

## Technologies Used

* Java
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Basic Compiler/Interpreter Design Concepts

## How to Run

Run the test classes in an IDE such as IntelliJ:

1. Lexer tests
2. Parser tests
3. InterpreterTest.java
